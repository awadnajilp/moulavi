## Understanding the Debug Logs

```

### Error Logs (❌)

**Configuration Error:**
```
[WHATSAPP] ❌ ERROR: WhatsApp API key not configured
[WHATSAPP] Environment variable WHATSAPP_API_KEY is missing or empty
```

**Network Error:**
```
[WHATSAPP] ❌ EXCEPTION: Error sending WhatsApp message
[WHATSAPP] Error Type: AxiosError
[WHATSAPP] Error Message: timeout of 10000ms exceeded
[WHATSAPP] Request was made but no response received
```

**API Error:**
```
[WHATSAPP] ❌ API ERROR: Invalid phone number
[WHATSAPP] Full Response: { "status": "error", "message": "Invalid phone number" }
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "WhatsApp API key not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Go to Coolify → Your Backend Service → Environment Variables
2. Add `WHATSAPP_API_KEY` with your API key value
3. Add `WHATSAPP_INSTANCE_ID` with your instance ID
4. Restart the service

### Issue 2: "Request was made but no response received"
**Possible Causes:**
- Network connectivity issue from droplet
- Firewall blocking outbound requests
- DNS resolution failure
- API endpoint is down

**Solution:**
1. Check if your droplet can reach the internet:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://wa.smsidea.com
   ```
2. Check firewall rules in DigitalOcean
3. Verify API endpoint is accessible
4. Check DNS resolution:
   ```bash
   nslookup wa.smsidea.com
   ```

### Issue 3: "Invalid phone number"
**Solution:**
- Ensure phone number is in correct format
- For India: Use `91` followed by 10 digits (e.g., `919876543210`)
- Remove all spaces, dashes, and special characters
- Don't include `+` sign

### Issue 4: "API Error: [error message]"
**Solution:**
- Check the full error response in logs
- Verify your API key and instance ID are correct
- Check if your WhatsApp API account has sufficient credits
- Verify the phone number is registered on WhatsApp

### Issue 5: Messages not being received
**Solution:**
1. Verify the phone number is correct
2. Check if the number has WhatsApp installed
3. Verify the number hasn't blocked your WhatsApp Business account
4. Check API response in logs - it might show success but message not delivered

### Issue 6: GET vs POST Request Method
**Solution:**
- The API supports both GET and POST requests
- POST is recommended (more secure, API key in body not URL)
- To use GET, set `WHATSAPP_REQUEST_METHOD=GET` in environment variables
- Default is POST (more secure)

### Issue 7: Image sending fails
**Solution:**
1. Ensure image URL is publicly accessible (not behind authentication)
2. Verify image URL is valid and returns image content
3. Check image format is supported (JPG, PNG, etc.)
4. Verify `WHATSAPP_IMAGE_API_URL` is set correctly
5. Check image size limits from your API provider

## Phone Number Format

The system automatically formats phone numbers:
- Input: `+91 90044 81414` → Output: `919876543210`
- Input: `9876543210` → Output: `919876543210` (adds 91 prefix)
- Input: `919876543210` → Output: `919876543210` (keeps as is)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend service is running
- [ ] Can access test endpoint with admin token
- [ ] Test custom message works
- [ ] Test credentials template works
- [ ] Test service confirmation template works
- [ ] Test movement update template works
- [ ] Test iqama confirmation template works
- [ ] Test image sending works
- [ ] Test bulk messaging works
- [ ] Comprehensive test (all types) works

## Getting Admin Token for Testing

1. Login to your application as admin

2. Monitor production logs for any issues
3. Set up alerts for WhatsApp failures if needed
4. Document any custom configurations

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs first - they contain detailed error information
